Table problems
----------------

- We have extra vertical space in the table elements on Slashdot and
  other sites.

- Printing of tables is (almost) completely broken and corrupts
  colors and other properties of the tables.  After you print, the
  table is all corrupt.

- We need to clean up the table code because it's rather unmanageable.
  A rewrite would be good, but I am not sure it's feasible.  So let's
  stick to a generic cleanup unless things become *really*
  unmanageable.

- Selection in elements that are contained in tables does not work.
  (Easy.  We just need to implement the `forall' method for table
  elements, and then things should work out automatically.)

- ROWSPAN/COLSPAN does not work.

* Form problems
---------------

- Resizing messes up forms, and then scrolling behaves erratically.

* Misc problems
---------------

- The API needs some loving.  (FIXME: come up with a list of things
  that are ugly/broken/etc.)

- `PRE' is broken.

- The parser can crash sometimes, and this is embarassing.  Let's load
  it with lots of random/inappropriate data and let's make it sure
  this does not happen *ever*.

- Header links in Slashdot appear as green (and are thus invisible)
  while they should be white.

- Animations are not handled.  We should be using the GdkPixbuf
  interface for this.

- We might want to speed up redraw on expose.

* Missing features:
-------------------

- Selection does not actually put anything into the X clipboard.

- Cursor keys do not work with the scrollbars.

- The HTML non-editing component is not finished.  (Easy.)
