Table problems
----------------

- Printing of tables is (almost) completely broken and corrupts
  colors and other properties of the tables.  After you print, the
  table is all corrupt.

- We need to clean up the table code because it's rather unmanageable.
  A rewrite would be good, but I am not sure it's feasible.  So let's
  stick to a generic cleanup unless things become *really*
  unmanageable.

- ROWSPAN/COLSPAN does not (always) work.

* Form problems
---------------

- Resizing messes up forms, and then scrolling behaves erratically.

* Misc problems
---------------

- The API needs some loving.  (FIXME: come up with a list of things
  that are ugly/broken/etc.)

- The parser can crash sometimes, and this is embarassing.  Let's load
  it with lots of random/inappropriate data and let's make it sure
  this does not happen *ever*.

- We might want to speed up redraw on expose.

- If a page renders with a link under the cursor, the link cannot be
  clicked unless you move the cursor off the link and then back on

- Lots of memory leaks.

* Sites that look wrong
-----------------------

- http://www.altavista.com is not 100% correct.

- http://www.stjerneskolan.com is broken (some elements are laid out
  horizontally instead of vertically).  Looks like a bug in the (table?)
  parser: if I move spaces around in the source HTML, then things work
  right.  The same problem happens somewhere after clicking on some
  http://www.cocacola.com link.

- In http://www.helixcode.com, the "GNOME Desktop" logo on the right
  is misaligned.

* Editor bugs
-------------

- Setting the paragraph style in a region is kind of broken in many
  cases.

- Pasting misbehaves in some cases.

- The amount of scrolling performed by PageUp/PageDown is not correct.
