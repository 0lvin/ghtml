* Missing features in GtkHTML the editor
----------------------------------------

- Keyboard-based selection is missing.  (Requires selection code

- Undo is not handled for all the operations.

- We don't allow editing of everything yet.

- We need hooks to edit images and links.

- We need a command to turn a whole region into a link.

- Keybindings should be somewhat configurable.

- The horizontal size of the document is not updated correctly if the
  minimum size of the current edited line becomes larger than it.
