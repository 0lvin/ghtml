Todo for gtkhtml:

* Font support must be improved:

	. In htmlfont.c, there's a function that takes a number of
	  arguments, allocs a font struct and creates an xlfd. The
	  "creating an xlfd" part must be improved so that it'll take
	  care of font family and the fact that bold/italic is named
	  differently on different fonts.

	. Refcounting/duplication is broken all over the place.

* Full support for all HTML tags

* Fix memory leaks

* Scrolling speed

* Fix all those annoying bugs :)

* Implement cool new features

* gtk_html_write_data (GtkHTML *html, gchar *txt, guint len) API.

* kill the daft PersistStream interface ( I'm a moron ), and use PersistFile.
