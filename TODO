Todo for gtkhtml:

* Font support must be improved, so that it picks up the X font with
  more smartness.

* Full support for all HTML tags

* Fix memory leaks

* Scrolling speed

* Alignment is broken in some ways.  Slashdot is not always right, for
  example: flowing around images is not correct.  Also `<br
  align=right>' does not work as expected.

* The tokenizer eats spaces in stuff like <tag>something <tag>.

* Itemized list do not support numbers (we have to make a simple
  HTMLClueFlow hack for that).
