Todo for gtkhtml:

* Font support must be improved:
	in htmlfont.c, there's a function that takes a number of arguments,
	allocs a font struct and creates an xlfd. The "creating an xlfd" part
	must be improved so that it'll take care of font family and the fact
	that bold/italic is named differently on different fonts.

* Full support for all HTML tags

* Fix memory leaks

* Scrolling speed

* Fix all those annoying bugs :)

* Implement cool new features

* gtk_html_write_data (GtkHTML *html, gchar *txt, guint len) API.

* kill the daft PersistStream interface ( I'm a moron ), and use PersistFile.
