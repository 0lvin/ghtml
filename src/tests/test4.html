           As I'm sure many of you know I'm a big Computer
          Animation nut. And when pixar dusts off the gloves and
          releases a movie, I really have no option but to be there
          opening night. This time it proved to be very worth
          skipping out a half hour early to catch one of the best
          movies of the year. Click below to read the
          review.

          "Since the day the Internet became popular and the good
          old BBS's faded into the back ground, I myself have had a
          hard time finding the same kind of active community. Sure
          there&rsquo;s Slashdot, BugTraq, and IRC, but for
          whatever reason it seems people remain private and keep
          to themselves without a <b>who's online</b> option, and a
          message feature. I do see other Slashdot members posting
          often, but there are allot more people that read the
          articles and have opinions that remain in the background.
          I guess my question is if anyone has found the same kind
          of thing as the old BBS's?"
