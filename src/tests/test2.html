Hi,

It is indeed a GTK+ bug; GtkButton keeps track of whether the mouse
pointer is inside or outside the button by monitoring enter/leave events
on the button. In the case you describe there is never an enter event so
the button doesn't know the mouse is inside it. Clicks are cancelled if
the mouse goes outside the button before you release the mouse button.
