	** Initial revision of the new HTML editor component developed
	   on the mbarnes-composer branch.  This new editor looks and acts
	   like the old HTML editor, but does not use Bonobo or GnomeSpell.
	   It is a subclass of GtkWindow, and the menus and toolbars are
	   extensible via GtkUIManager.
