	* Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Use `top_builddir' so that it works with
	builddir != srcdir.

	* Makefile.am (gtkhtml_properties_capplet_LDADD): we include
	../src/gtkhtml-properties.o in LDADD - this is quite ugly, some
	automake volunteer? Or maybe we should move capplet to src dir?
	(gtkhtml_properties_capplet_LDADD): removed -lgconf-gtk which was
	hack and is fixed now

	* new directory for capplet
