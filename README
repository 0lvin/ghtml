This is gtkhtml, a port of khtmlw to gtk+ and C

To try it out, run testgtkhtml in the source dir, i.e:

cd src
./testgtkhtml

To build the bonobo component, pass --with-bonobo to configure.
Note that it doesn't really work yet, it's just an illusion ;)
If you want to try it anyway, start a sample-container or 
gnumeric-bonobo and add "a html component". Activate it and
choose a test page in the Html menu.
