This is GtkHTML, a lightweight HTML rendering/printing/editing engine.
It was originally based on KHTMLW, but is now being developed
independently of it.

In order to compile GtkHTML, you need the latest gdk-pixbuf and
gnome-print from CVS.

You also need libwww, although this is going to change soon.  Libwww
is available from:

    http://www.w3.org/Library/

The libwww library must be compiled *with* zlib support.  Make sure
zlib is installed properly before compiling libwww if you do this by
hand.  The pre-built libwww packages shipped by Linux distributions
all have zlib support compiled in already AFAIK.

To try it out, run testgtkhtml in the source dir, i.e:

    cd src
    ./testgtkhtml

To build the bonobo components, pass the command-line options
`--with-bonobo' to configure.
