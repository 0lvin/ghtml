This is GtkHTML, a lightweight HTML rendering/printing/editing engine.
It was originally based on KHTMLW, but is now being developed
independently.

In order to compile GtkHTML, you need gdk-pixbuf 0.6.0 (or later) and
gnome-print 0.13 (or later).

If you want to try the test program `testgtkhtml', you also need
libwww.  Libwww is available from:

    http://www.w3.org/Library/

The libwww library must be compiled *with* zlib support.  The
pre-built libwww packages shipped by Linux distributions all have zlib
support compiled in already AFAIK.

To try it out, run testgtkhtml in the source dir, i.e:

    cd src
    ./testgtkhtml

WARNING: testgtkhtml's URL fetching code is very buggy.
