What is GtkHTML?
----------------

GtkHTML is a lightweight HTML rendering/printing/editing engine.
It was originally based on KHTMLW, part of the KDE project, but is now being 
developed independently.

Requirements
------------

In order to compile GtkHTML, you need gdk-pixbuf 0.8.0 (or later),
Bonobo 0.23 (or later), gnome-print 0.29 (or later) and GAL 0.3 (or later).

Optionally you may want to install GConf 0.4 (or later) to enable the
configuration capplet.

If you want to try the test program `testgtkhtml', you also need
glibwww 0.2 or later.  GLibWWW is available from:

    ftp://www.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/unstable/sources/glibwww/

To try it out, run testgtkhtml in the source directory, i.e:

    cd src
    ./testgtkhtml

WARNING: testgtkhtml's URL fetching code is very buggy.
