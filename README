This is gtkhtml, a port of khtmlw to gtk+ and C

To try it out, run testgtkhtml in the source dir, i.e:

cd src
./testgtkhtml

To build the bonobo component, pass --with-bonobo to configure.
Note that this component is just a quick hack. The official
html component is in gnome-fm/src/components/html/ and this
one is not maintained much or at all. It will probably be
removed soon.
